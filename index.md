# Welcome to Zombie Outbreak Roleplay!
There is not much here right now as this site is a work in progress. In time there will be more here but for now the important links are in place. The main focus is on the gamemode itself and the main hub of the community is on our Discord, you can see development updates, discuss the server along with many other topics.

We are still setting up this site and the community hub which can be found [here](https://github.com/outbreakomp/community).
